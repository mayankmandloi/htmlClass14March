    <p>A Ballad of Heaven :


        He wrought at one great work for years ;
        The world passed by with lofty look;
        Sometimes his eyes were dashed with tears ;
        Sometimes his lips with laughter shook.
        
        
        His wife and child went clothed in rags,
        And in a windy garret starved ;
        He trod his measure on the flags,
        And high on heaven his music carved.
        
        
        Wistful he grew but never feared ;
        For always on the midnight skies
        His rich orchestral score appeared
        In stars and zones and galaxies.
        
        
        He thought to copy down his score ;
        The moonlight was his lamp; he said,
        ‘Listen my love,’ but on the floor
        His wife and child were lying dead.</p>
